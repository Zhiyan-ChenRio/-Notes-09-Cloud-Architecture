Reliability: In the AWS Well-Architected Framework, planning for failure means designing for reliability and availability.
What is Reliability : Reliability assesses a system's consistent performance, considering hardware, software, and the likelihood of failures, with metrics like MTBF, MTTF, and MTTR.
Availability: Availability in computing refers to the percentage of time a service is accessible for use, typically measured as "number of 9's" (e.g., "five nines" means 99.999% availability), with factors like fault tolerance, scalability, and recoverability influencing it.
High Availability: High availability (HA) ensures consistent, uninterrupted system operation by minimizing downtime and human intervention, functioning as a failure response mechanism in infrastructure, and allowing systems to automatically recover from failures.
AWS Well-Architected Tool: The AWS Well-Architected Tool is a free resource in the AWS Management Console that evaluates your workloads against AWS best practices, offering recommendations to enhance reliability, security, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness throughout the product lifecycle.
AWS Trusted Advisor: AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that offers real-time guidance for optimizing AWS resources in terms of cost, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits, helping users adhere to best practices and improve their AWS infrastructure.
